## Description 

> You can't manage what you cannot measure. 
> - Peter Drucker

Tracking workout progress is a proven method for reaching fitness goals faster. The Workout Tracker is an application designed to empower users on their fitness journey by creating and tracking daily workouts. 

Users are able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Based on the type of exercise, each entry can be tracked by the name, weight, sets, reps, distance, and duration of exercise. 

The application utilizes a JavaScript front-end and a Node.js backend. The noSQL database used is MongoDB with a Mongoose schema.
